# Multiple Disease Prediction

This web application was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned. The webapp can predict following Diseases:

* Breast Cancer.
* Diabetes.
* Heart Disease.
* Kidney Disease.

### Models with their Accuracies of Prediction

| Disease | Type of Model | Accuracy |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Breast Cancer | Machine Learning Model | 96.49% | 
| Diabetes | Machine Learning Model | 74.03 |
| Heart | Machine Learning Model | 86.89% |
| Kidney | Machine Learning Model | 99% |
